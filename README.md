The object of this program is to iterate through multiple investor guidelines and find the investor that matches the query of the user. 
For example if a user is looking for an investor that matches the query:
"I need an investor that can do a bank statement loan for a borrower with a 640 credit score at a 60% loan-to-value" ...
The program will return that investor as a result with a probability of match.

The downfall of this program has been that basic text LLM's do not understand tabular data very well, and while it will return some accurate results, there are too many innacuracies.
I intend to pick this project back up using a model that understand tabular data more completely.
